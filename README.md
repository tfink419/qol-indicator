## My Quality of Life Indicator

### About
This site shows you the quality of life in a given area
To view in action go to https://www.pitamap.com

### Why
This site was created as a demo for Snapdocs inc. It is based on a need that I had wanted from when researching to live in Denver, moving all the way from Florida and only knowing 2 people in the area. It's difficult to know how your life will be in an area without doing a lot of research and being aware of the factors that you would consider important.


### Future Goals
- Incorporate other types of quality indicators
  - access to transit
  - Job rates
  - Homeless populations
  - Crime rates
- ad's ðŸ¤”
- Tests would be good

### QualityMapImage
Long detailed discussion about how I handle images through libvips and CUDA as both data and visual representations
