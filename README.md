## My Quality of Life Indicator

### About
This site shows you the quality of life in a given area

### Why
This site was created as a demo for Snapdocs inc. It is based on a need that I had wanted from when researching to live in Denver, moving all the way from Florida and only knowing 2 people in the area. It's difficult to know how your life will be in an area without doing a lot of research and being aware of the factors that you would consider important.


### Future Goals
- Incorporate other types of quality indicators
  - access to transit
  - Median income
  - Job rates
  - Homeless populations
  - Crime rates
- Get a report at a point/address
- ad's ðŸ¤”
- Tests would be good
